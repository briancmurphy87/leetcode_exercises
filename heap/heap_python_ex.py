# Construct an empty Max Heap
# As there are no internal functions to construct a Max Heap in Python,
# So, we will not construct a Max Heap.

# Construct a Heap with Initial values
# this process is called "Heapify"
# The Heap is a Min Heap
heapWithValues = [3,1,2]
heapq.heapify(heapWithValues)

# Trick in constructing a Max Heap
# As there are no internal functions to construct a Max Heap
# We can multiply each element by -1, then heapify with these modified elements.
# The top element will be the smallest element in the modified set,
# It can also be converted to the maximum value in the original dataset.
# Example
maxHeap = [1,2,3]
maxHeap = [-x for x in maxHeap]
heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
# The top element of maxHeap is -3
# Convert -3 to 3, which is the maximum value in the original maxHeap
